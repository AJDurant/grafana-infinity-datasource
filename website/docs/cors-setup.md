## Using proxy server

Some URLs you might not able to access directly due to CORS restriction set by the websites. At that time, you may need to use proxy servers or hosted services as mentioned [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/32167044/1576253). Example: Use **https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup** to connect with wikipedia.
